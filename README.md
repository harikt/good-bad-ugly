# The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

There are lot's of open-source libraries.

I have used many of them and have helped me. Thank you.

A very small amount have burned my energy and introduced lots of frustration.

This repo is source of truth. 

I would like to keep all the tools I used with examples, so I can easily dive into on another day.

## Why the NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome ?

* Person `X` looked for something.
* `X` found a library that does it.
* `X` didn't like the implementation.
* `X` wrote a new one.
* `X` open-sourced it.
* `X` promotes the libraray.
* People started sharing / promoting it.
* Advance feature documentation sucks!. Lots of issues for help.
* People started promoting it and using it.
* Sending PR for bugs or features.
* `X` became burned out / have different priorities.
* Now `Y` will come and go the same path ;-).

Sorry not blaming anyone. We are all humans, and open-source don't give anything to eat.

Thank you for all what you do.

Just a random thought.
